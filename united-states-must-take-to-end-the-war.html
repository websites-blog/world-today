				<h1>What Does United States Must Take to End Ukraine War</h1>
					<p>
						When Russia began to launch a full-scale invasion in Ukraine on February 2022, the most active country who stood up on the side of Ukraine to help and fight the aggressions is the United States and the European Union. Which is by providing any kind of military support to Ukraine, its about to ensure the international security not only in Europe but also globally. However because of the unwavering support of the United States it has provoke any misunderstanding that has result to argument as well between Ukraine and Russia even to its allies.
					</p>
					<p>
						The United States play a very important role especially for ensuring the international security. Ukraine's battle against Russia should concern the entire globe. So what will happen if United States continue to support Ukraine? Here's a perspective there is a possibility that the situation of the armed conflict between the two countries will just become more complicated. That Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned the United States government to stay out which they had refuses to do so instead continue supporting Ukraine. And for that reason Vladimir Putin will be more irritated as long as the United States continue to interfere. Which by any chance Putin will continue to enforce any violence force against Ukraine, therefore it could escalate more conflict. And because of that it make sense for Putin that Ukraine and its allies shows that they want to declare a war against Russia at some point. 
					</p>
					<p>
						What United States must take to end the war in Ukraine without enforcing any kind of violence force? One of the most efficient way that United States government must do is that they must keep pressuring Ukraine and Russia especially to commit and to take a certain action to any kind of peace negotiations. Indeed it is one of the most effective solution that could end the war and now it is the right time to do it. Its because on the other hand Russia wants to end the war in Ukraine that involves any diplomatic solution and Putin also said that sooner the better. So therefore United States must push Ukraine to impose peace talk with Russia right now or sooner or by any chance Putin's mind will change suddenly.
